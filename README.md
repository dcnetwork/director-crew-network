### About

The Hollywood Director-Crew Networks website was built by [Ian MacDonald](https://www.ianmacdonald.me/), a junior studying Computer Science and Film & Media Studies at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/). The network model was created by [Dr. Alexander C. Nwala](https://alexandernwala.com/), assistant professor of Data Science at William & Mary, based on a research interest and idea of [Dr. Arthur Knight](https://www.wm.edu/as/english/facultystaff/knight_a.php), Associate Professor, American Studies and English at William & Mary.

This project was initially developed as a [group project](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-network-science/tree/main/spring-2023/homework/hw5-group) in an [undergraduate Network Science course](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-network-science/blob/main/spring-2023/README.md) taught by Dr. Alexander Nwala.

We thank the William & Mary Office of the Provost for funding this project through the 2023 Faculty Summer Research Grant Award.

### Development

This website was built using React + TypeScript + Vite. The graph data was modelled and exported using Gephi and is visualized using [React Sigma](https://sim51.github.io/react-sigma/) and [Graphology](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphology).
