            <p>
                Some renowned film directors are known to work persistently with the same key collaborators. 
                For example, Wes Anderson employed the same movie score composer, Alexandre Desplat,
                for multiple movies, including <i>The French Dispatch</i>, <i>Isle of Dogs</i>, and <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i>.

                Shifting ground to questions of access and representation: Some directors hire collaborators
                from groups that were historically prevented from working in the mainstream U.S. film industry
                &#8212; e.g., African Americans, women. Among the reasons given by such directors is that
                this opens opportunities and diversifies the U.S. film industry creative labor pool
                and, thus, expands the perspectives represented in and benefiting from U.S. movies and TV.

            <h3>Key Questions</h3>
            <p>
                How widespread is the phenomenon of directors re-using the same crew?
                Do renowned directors (and women/minority directors) tend to work persistently with
                the same key collaborators and less recognized directors tend to
                work with shifting groups of collaborators?
